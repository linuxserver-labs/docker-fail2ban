# application setup block
app_setup_block_enabled: true

  This container is designed to allow fail2ban to function at the host level, as well as at the docker container level.
  If you are running applications on the host, you will need to set the `chain` to `INPUT` in the jail for that application.
  All jails require the ability to read the application log files.
  We recommend mounting each application's logs as a volume to the container (illustrated by the optional volumes in our documentation).

  ### Configuration Files

  On first run, the container will create a number of folders and files in `/config`. The default configurations for fail2ban are all disabled by default.

  Please refer to the [Configuration README](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-fail2ban/blob/master/root/defaults/fail2ban/README.md), which can be viewed in our repository, or in your config folder at `/config/fail2ban/README.md`.

  ### Remote Logs

  The `/remotelogs` path is designed to act as a parent for all log files you would like fail2ban to be able to use.
  Each log file should be mounted in a subfolder underneath `/remotelogs`, ex:
  - `/remotelogs/nginx/` would mount a folder containing the nginx logs to the container
  - `/remotelogs/unificontroller/server.log` would mount a single file for the unifi controller logs to the container

  ### Chains

  Chains affect how access is restricted. There are two primary ways to restrict access.

  #### `DOCKER-USER`

  The `DOCKER-USER` chain is used to restrict access to applications running in Docker containers. This will restrict access to all containers, not just the one that the jail is configured for.

  #### `INPUT`

  The `INPUT` chain is used to restrict access to applications running on the host. This will restrict access to the host network stack. The host network stack may not be inclusive of all Docker network stacks, thus the `DOCKER-USER` chain is used separately for applications running in Docker containers.

  #### `FORWARD` (for older versions of Docker)

  The `FORWARD` chain may be used on systems running older versions of Docker where the `DOCKER-USER` chain is not available.
